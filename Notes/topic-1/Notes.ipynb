    "7)\tSQLite uses a dynamic type system, which means that the data type of a value is associated with the value itself, not with its container (the column). This allows SQLite to be more flexible with the types of data it can store in a column. When you insert a floating-point value into a column with an INTEGER affinity, SQLite will try to convert it to an integer. If the floating-point value can be represented exactly as an integer, it will be converted and stored as an integer. If not, it will be stored as a REAL (floating-point) value. This behavior is guided by the type affinity of the column. For example, a column with INTEGER affinity will prefer to store values as integers, but it can also store floating-point values if necessary.\n"
